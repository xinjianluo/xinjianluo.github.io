        <p>
            I am a researcher at Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), working closely with Prof. <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/ting-yu/">Ting Yu</a>.
            I completed my Ph.D. at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore (NUS), under the guidance of Prof. <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiaoxk/">Xiaokui Xiao</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2019, I received my master's degree in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), where I worked with Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~gao-xf/">Xiaofeng Gao</a> 
            on my master's thesis. Additionally, I collaborated with Prof. <a href="http://202.118.1.237/yangxc/index.html">Xiaochun Yang </a> on distributed metadata management and 
            Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/PeopleDetail.aspx?id=176">Qianni Deng</a> on designing two-stage exams to enhance student performance. Prior to joining SJTU, 
            I earned my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Dalian University of Technology in 2016, where I worked with Prof. <a href="http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/DUT_BinLiu/zh_CN/index.htm">Bin Liu</a> 
            on computer-assisted surgeries and Prof. <a href="http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/2012011156/zh_CN/index.htm">Cheng Guo</a> on secret image sharing. These experiences helped me accumulate valuable 
            research insights and gain a better understanding of the computer science landscape.
        </p>
            <!-- Dr. Xinjian Luo received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the National University of Singapore in 2024. He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher with Prof. Ting Yu, where his work investigates the privacy risks of large language models (LLMs), including Mixture-of-Experts architectures, multimodal systems, and reasoning frameworks. His research centers on principled attacks against the cutting-edge machine learning systems, with a particular focus on uncovering vulnerabilities and privacy risks in data preprocessing, model training and inference. Instead of focusing solely on defensive techniques, his work emphasizes exposing hidden threats and behaviors in AI systems, thereby deepening the understanding of their inference mechanisms and contributing to the development of more trustworthy and reliable AI.
     
            Dr. Luo’s research has been published in top conferences across security, data management, and artificial intelligence, including ACM CCS, IEEE S&P, NDSS, VLDB, ICDE, AAAI, IEEE TIFS, and IEEE TKDE. His long-term research vision is to build a rigorous foundation for evaluating and mitigating privacy and security risks in next-generation AI, ensuring that advanced models can be deployed responsibly in real-world applications. -->

	<h2 id="sec-rinterests">My Research Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
      I love creating simple yet powerful attacks on the latest ML applications and systems. Why? First, it&apos;s the perfect excuse to dive deep into cutting-edge tech, constantly learning how the newest tools work. Second, it lets me uncover the hidden quirks &mdash; both vulnerabilities and strengths &mdash; of these systems, which is endlessly thrilling. Improving existing attacks? Not my cup of tea. For me, the joy lies in exploring the unknown, not refining what&apos;s already been done. That&apos;s why you&apos;ll never see me working on the same target application twice &mdash; every publication is a fresh adventure with new discoveries.
  </p>
  <p>
      Defenses? Let&apos;s just say they don&apos;t spark the same excitement. Empirical defenses are like a cat-and-mouse game: you patch one hole, and another attack pops up. Encryption-based defenses are so focused on security that they forget utility &mdash; like entering a car race with a tank instead of a car. Differential Privacy (DP), while promising, trades performance for security, which isn&apos;t always appealing.
  </p>
  <p>
      Here&apos;s how I see it: building ML applications is like racing a car through treacherous terrain. Empirical defenses are the pit stop for a tire change when you hit a nail &mdash; useful, but reactive. Encryption-based defenses? They turn your car into a tank &mdash; safe, but slow. DP defenses are like tempered glass upgrades &mdash; better safety, but at the cost of speed. The problem is that everyone wants the fastest car to win. Designing attacks, then, is like spotting vulnerabilities in these racing cars beforehand and warning drivers before disaster strikes. It&apos;s proactive, impactful, and, most importantly, exhilarating.
